# fail login sms

Coded this flashcard CLI when I was relatively new to coding. Works pefectly fine as a flashcard but could make more QOL changes.
Made this during the first year of my polytechnic where I was very new to coding, I was inspired by a flashcode software called anki. This script allows user to create their own folder and flashcards in CLI. The code should be pretty bad since I coded it when I was very inexperience.
